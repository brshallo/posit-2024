### Understanding, Generating, and Evaluating Prediction Intervals
ðŸ’¬ Bryan Shalloway

For many problems concerning prediction, providing intervals is more useful than just offering point estimates. This talk will provide an overview of:

- How to think about uncertainty in your predictions (e.g. noise in the data vs uncertainty in estimation)
- Approaches to producing prediction intervals (e.g. parametric vs conformal)
- Measures and considerations when evaluating and training models for prediction intervals

While I will touch on some similar topics as Max Kuhnâ€™s posit::conf(2023) talk on conformal inference, my talk will cover different points and have a broader focus. I hope attendees gain an understanding of some of the key tools and concepts related to prediction intervals and that they leave inspired to learn more.
